h1. Setup

h2. Requirements

p. Zend_Framework 1.11.3 (hope that newer versions also works with this code:)
* Requires PHP 5.3.x
* Small modifications to Bootstrap and application.ini

h2. Bootstrap

p. There are few things that needed for this to run
In our application/Bootstrap.php we need to add this method

@protected function _initConfig()
{
    $config = new Zend_Config($this->getOptions(), true);
    Zend_Registry::set('config', $config);
    return $config;
}@

p. Thats because I dont see any other "shortcuts" to get the Zend_Config application.ini data

h2. application.ini

In our application/configs/application.ini
we need the following

@autoloadernamespaces[] = Maa@

p. So the Directory can be found

h2. Examples

p. Now library/Maa/_examples/application.ini.sample for more configuration

p. For a an working example see application/layouts/scripts/layout.phtml

p. For documentation see public/doc/index.html
