== Setup ==
= Requirements =
Zend_Framework 1.11.3 (hope that newer versions also works with this code:)
Requires PHP 5.3.x
Small modifications to Bootstrap and application.ini

= Bootstrap =
There are few things that needed for this to run
In our application/Bootstrap.php we need to add this method

protected function _initConfig()
{
    $config = new Zend_Config($this->getOptions(), true);
    Zend_Registry::set('config', $config);
    return $config;
}

Thats because I dont see any other "shortcuts" to get the Zend_Config application.ini data

= application.ini =
In our application/configs/application.ini
we need the following

autoloadernamespaces[] = Maa

So the Directory can be found

Now @see application.ini.sample for more configuration
